> Last updated 26-05-2020.

In this public repository we gather tutorials, frequently asked questions, and showcases. If you are encountering any problems using our services or have suggestions for improvements, please do let us know by [creating a new issue](https://github.com/scailable/sclbl-tutorials/issues/new). 

## Tutorials

* [sclbl-101-getting-started](https://github.com/scailable/sclbl-tutorials/tree/master/sclbl-101-getting-started): A step-by-step explanation of the use of Scailable. This tutorial shows how to sign up for a *beta* account, and how to create a first Scailable endpoint using the `sclblpy` package. The tutorial ends with a [simple UI](https://www.scailable.net/demo/salary) that consumes a fitted `xgboost` model. 
* [sclbl-create-your-own-wasm](https://github.com/scailable/sclbl-tutorials/tree/master/sclbl-create-your-own-wasm): This tutorial shows how to create your own custom WebAssembly executable using `c` (and the [wasienv](https://medium.com/wasmer/wasienv-wasi-development-workflow-for-humans-1811d9a50345) toolchain) that can be deployed on the Scailable platform.

## Interactive demos
Next to the tutorials presented in this repository, we also have a number of interactive demos:

1. [Predicting a developers salary](https://www.scailable.net/demo/salary). Based on the most recent [Stack Overflow](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019) survey, we created a simple model to predict the yearly salary of developers; give it [a spin](https://www.scailable.net/demo/salary/)! This simple front-end supports our getting started tutorial: [Scailable 101: Getting started](https://github.com/scailable/sclbl-tutorials/tree/master/sclbl-101-getting-started).
2. [Scailable supports running complex models](https://www.scailable.net/demo/avm/) (such at [Bayesian Additive Regression Trees](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoas/1273584455)) in the cloud, on the edge, or on a browser. Check how we can flexibly generate posterior predictive inferences for automatic property valuation models, anytime, anywhere.
3. [Sometimes what you need is performance](https://www.scailable.net/demo/bench/). We provide nothing less. The inferences from our models are extremely fast; check out some of our benchmarks.
